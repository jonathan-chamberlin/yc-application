# Accomplishments

# Q1 Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
At call center startup Event Sales Agency, I increased our calls center phone pickup rate from 5% to 70% (14x). Since most people don't answer the phone, our salespeople were spending most of their time waiting for someone to answer. So I designed live transfer procedures, trained the virtual assistants and sales reps, and deployed the system successfully. Additionally, I sorted phone numbers based on mobile, toll-free, and VoIP, and had our salespeople call in that order, increasing the pickup rate too.

At the same company, our salespeople were working 60 hours per week. They were burning out. So I analyzed 13,000 sales transactions to find the 40 best hours to sell, then restructured the team schedule. We kept revenue within 5% of revenue while reps worked 15 fewer hours/week, greatly increasing employee satisfaction.

At my marketing agency Rocket Rise, I created a cold email system sending 2,900 emails/day, and built and automation which read an email reply, and if it was positive it sent me a slack message, letting me call prospects in 60 seconds. This was important because it greatly increased the pickup rate.

# Q2 Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

Ranked #1 salesperson on 2 separate teams (top of 15 door-to-door solar reps at Lumio, top of 4 phone reps at MOA), generating $647,473+ in revenue. This was twice the team average, and I spoke to 68.7% more prospects each week than average rep, demonstrating work ethic.

On Instagram, I got 4.1 million views of my personal brand. This led to about 20 sales people reaching out to me asking to work on my sales team. 

# Q3 Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you've built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.
