# Accomplishments

# Q1 Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
At call center startup Event Sales Agency, I increased our calls center phone pickup rate from 5% to 70% (14x). Since most people didn't answer the phone, our salespeople were spending way too much time waiting for someone to pickup. So I designed live transfer system, trained the virtual assistants and sales reps, and deployed the it successfully. Additionally, I sorted phone numbers based on mobile, toll-free, and VoIP, and had our salespeople call in that order, increasing the pickup rate more.

At the same company, our salespeople were burning out from working 60 hours per week. So I analyzed 13,000 sales transactions to find the 40 best hours to sell, then restructured the team schedule. We kept revenue within 5% of revenue while reps worked 20 fewer hours/week, greatly increasing employee satisfaction.

At my marketing agency Rocket Rise, I created a cold email system sending 2,900 emails/day. I also built and automation which read email replies, and if it was positive it sent me a slack message, letting me call prospects in 60 seconds. This was important because it greatly increased the pickup rate.

# Q2 Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

Ranked #1 salesperson on 2 separate teams (top of 15 door-to-door solar reps at Lumio, top of 4 phone reps at Men of Action), generating $647,473+ in revenue. My revenue per month was twice the team average. I worked hard and spoke to 68.7% more prospects each week than average rep. I trained 8 new reps and helped 5 of them get their first deal in their first week.

On Instagram, I got 4.1 million views of my personal brand. This led to ~20 sales people reaching out asking to work on my sales team. 

# Q3 Tell us about things you've built before. For example apps you've built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.
